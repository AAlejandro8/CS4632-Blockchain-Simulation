# Blockchain Transaction Propagation Simulation (CS 4632)

## üìä Overview
This project simulates transaction propagation in peer-to-peer blockchain networks to identify key factors affecting efficiency. By modeling network topology, latency, and bandwidth constraints, this simulation provides insights into decentralized network dynamics and protocol optimization applicable beyond Bitcoin to other blockchain systems.

## üîç Research Focus
The simulation examines how different network parameters impact transaction propagation in blockchain networks. The primary goals are to:

1. Analyze the impact of network topology on transaction propagation speed
2. Evaluate how bandwidth constraints affect network throughput
3. Measure the influence of node latency on overall network performance
4. Identify bottlenecks in transaction propagation

## üåê Why Small-World Network?
A small-world network topology was selected as the primary model because it closely resembles real-world blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Small-world networks are characterized by:

1. **High Clustering**: Nodes tend to form clusters with their neighbors
2. **Short Path Lengths**: Despite clustering, there are short paths between any two nodes

These properties reflect the structure of actual blockchain networks where:
- Nodes connect to geographically close peers (clustering)
- The network maintains "long-range" connections that ensure quick propagation globally
- Information can efficiently spread despite the network's decentralized nature

Small-world networks represent a balance between completely random networks (which lack realistic clustering) and regular lattice networks (which lack efficient paths). This balance provides an optimal model for studying real-world blockchain transaction propagation.

## üíª Implementation
